Created by javacool.


ID-Blaster Plus takes the original ID-Blaster to a whole new level! Edit and create your own lists of IDs to "blast" to increase your privacy. Share and download lists over the Internet. Merge lists, and much much more.


NEW USERS: Only items that are checked in the main ID-Blaster Plus window will be randomized - any unchecked items will still be saved, but will not be randomized. Saving your list also saves and the enabled/disabled settings for each item.
