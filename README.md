Bypass hard ban (by hardware)
Guide on how to remove a hardware ban in almost any game

1 CHANGE IP ADDRESS
So let's get started, first of all we will change the IP, to do this we simply reboot the router (if you have a dynamic IP), and if it is static, then we call the provider and ask him about it!

2. Change MAC address
Install and open TMAC
check the box next to Use "02" as first octet of MAC address
Click on Random MAC address
And click Change Now!
And if you did everything correctly, then you will see this window!: MAC addres was changed successfully

3. Change HWID
The next thing we will do is change our HWID using the HardDiskSerialNumberChanger program
(suitable for all types of HDD, SSD, m2 storage devices)
Run it as administrator, select the disk and in this field enter any value in the format XXXX-XXXX
We do these actions with all our disks.
After that, restart your computer

4. Change the serial number and UUID
IMPORTANT! Change the motherboard serial number and UUID
Download the program GRINX64v2
Open the folder and copy its path
Run CMD as administrator and write there - cd [path to folder]
We enter the command - AMIDEWINx64.EXE /SU /BS
Changing UUID :
Enter the command - AMIDEWINx64.EXE /SU auto
Changing the motherboard serial number
Enter the command - AMIDEWINx64.EXE /BS [Your motherboard serial number]
And we change the last 2-4 digits to any other ones
Press ENTER AND THAT'S IT.

In all fields, click generate and change after generation
