Bypass hard ban (by hardware)
Guide on how to remove a hardware ban in almost any game

1 CHANGE IP ADDRESS
So let's get started, first of all we will change the IP, to do this we simply reboot the router (if you have a dynamic IP), and if it is static, then we call the provider and ask him about it!

2. Change MAC address
Install and open TMAC
check the box next to Use "02" as first octet of MAC address

3. Change HWID
The next thing we will do is change our HWID using the HardDiskSerialNumberChanger program
(suitable for all types of HDD, SSD, m2 storage devices)
Run it as administrator, select the disk and in this field enter any value in the format XXXX-XXXX

We do these actions with all our disks.
After that, restart your computer

5. Change the serial number and UUID

Changing UUID :
Enter the command - AMIDEWINx64.EXE /SU auto
Changing the motherboard serial number
Enter the command - AMIDEWINx64.EXE /BS [Your motherboard serial number]
And we change the last 2-4 digits to any other ones
